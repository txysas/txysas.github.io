                    <p class="text-muted">TEDxYouth@SAS is an organization that seeks to provide a number of opportunities for people to share ideas. We were created in the spirit of <b><a href="https://ted.com" target="_blank">TED</a></b>’s mission, “<u>ideas worth spreading</u>.” Our events are planned and coordinated by a <b><a href="#team">team</a></b> of volunteers with support from individuals and organizations within and outside of the Singapore American School.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                    TEDxYouth@SAS is an empowering opportunity for a diverse range of speakers to express fascinating ideas on issues that they feel are significant to share with the Singapore American School community. On <b><i>March 17th, 2017</i></b>, the third TEDxYouth event at the Singapore American School will both incite intellectual discussion and highlight unique perspectives otherwise hidden within the school.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">TEDxYouth</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, independently organized events that bring people together to share in a TED-like experience. At TEDxYouth@SAS and other TEDx events, TEDTalks videos and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self- organized events are branded TEDx, where 'x' signifies an independently organized TED event. The TED conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.</p>

We want to allow individuals to discuss explore the possibilies of the future, present, and past – to probe the ‘Prism of Possibilites’ and share ideas that might have otherwise gone unheard. The Prism of Possibilities conference will be our third official event.</p>

The event will bring together a diverse group of people, who want to be part of a vibrant community. And most importantly, TEDxYouth@SAS will provide a platform for the brightest minds to be inspired and to inspire others.</p>

                        <div class="details">Sunita Srivatsan first started exploring the intriguing concept of memory manipulation in her AP Seminar class last year. Since then, she has delved deeper into the issue to uncover the many ethical and philosophical implications that it poses. In her talk, she hopes to encourage audience members to reflect on the countless possibilities associated with memory manipulation. Currently a junior, Sunita has taken the opportunity in her past nine years at SAS to engage in a variety of extracurricular activities that have contributed to her interest in this topic. Her passion for STEM fields has led her to become an officer of the Science National Honor Society, Math Club, and Geek Girls, and she loves evaluating various viewpoints on global issues through public speaking activities like Debate and Model United Nations.

                        <div class="details">Despite our intentions, why do we so often fail to act in our own best interest? Why do we promise to skip the chocolate cake, only to find ourselves drooling our way into temptation when the dessert tray rolls around? Why do we overvalue things that we’ve worked to put together? What are the forces that influence our behavior? Dan Ariely, James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, is dedicated to answering these questions and others in order to help people live more sensible – if not rational – lives. His interests span a wide range of behaviors, and his sometimes unusual experiments are consistently interesting, amusing and informative, demonstrating profound ideas that fly in the face of common wisdom. He holds appointments at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business, the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, the Department of Economics, the School of Medicine, and is a senior fellow at the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke. He is a founding member of the Center for Advanced Hindsight and the author of the New York Times bestsellers Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty. In 2013 Bloomberg recognized Dan as one of Top 50 Most Influential thinkers. He also has a bi-weekly advice column in the Wall Street Journal called “Ask Ariely.” Dan can be found at www.danariely.com.</div>

In her talk, Vanessa will argue that although people should exercise tolerance towards different cultural and moral views, in terms of the legal code, certain cultures are superior to others. In addition, she will scrutinize both the dangers and the hypocrisies of moral and cultural relativism. Vanessa enjoys studying psychology and philosophy in her free time, and she has integrated her passion for philosophy into her TEDx talk.

In her TED talk she discusses how storytelling, a barrier-breaking form of communication, is far more prominent and important in our lives than we realize. Stories allow us to make sense of the world and our place in it, to create a sense of wonder, and to build an emotional connection with others. Her knowledge of this topic comes from years pursuing her passion for books as a voracious reader and from telling stories throughout her teenage years in the forms of theatre, writing, and music. She is an avid writer who finished her second novel this May and a musical theatre enthusiast with a love for singing, especially when other people don’t want her to.</div>

As an avid artist, she has been able to identify areas where art overlaps with math and science in her own life and imagines the possibilities that may arise if this correlation is more commonly used as an advantage. Because she has wanted to be an architect since she was young, she has constantly seen where the clearly defined barrier lies, and she believes that this barrier is must come down to achieve greater success in our quickly changing world.

                    <p>Matthew Oey is a junior at Singapore American School. He has always enjoyed playing video games, but what makes him unique is what he was able to do with this passion-- for him, video games weren’t a way to escape reality. Instead, he has made money, met countless new people, and and discovered a whole world in the industry of professional gaming. He himself was a member of one of Singapore’s professional video gaming teams, and he has competed in several tournaments around Asia. When not playing games, he enjoys running, playing the cello and watching movies.</p>

She loves to learn about everything, and every talk from relatable TCK stories to exploring life outside our world has given her a new perspective to see the world through. Outside of TEDx, Rhea is involved in a wide range of activities, from Debate, MUN, and HMC to Math Club. In her free time, she loves listening to music, going rollerblading near her house, and drinking bubble tea.</p>

As a curator, Avinash will work closely with speakers by improving their speeches and their delivery, while still maintaining the speaker's original voice. Outside of TEDx, Avinash is actively involved with MUN, Harvard Model Congress, the UN Women’s Rights movement in Singapore, and the Whole Tree Foundation, a foundation that actively seeks to combat mental health issues. He also enjoys playing the guitar and occasional walks -- to the fridge.</p>

An avid wildlife photographer and blogger, in her freshman year she gave a talk on the intersection between the Internet and conservation. The potential of TEDx as a platform for SAS’s rich and diverse community to share their ideas hit her hard and she’s unbelievably excited (read: fangirling) about the chance to be facilitating the display of those ideas to the world this year as a speaker curator. Outside of TEDx, Tanvi can often be found with a permanently bent neck looking for a bird that just flew past, and, oh my god, did you see its wings. Otherwise, she is an officer of Photo Club, Students Against Violation of the Environment, and Global Issues Networks, and shouts excitedly about nature to members of the public in the Toddycat’s Love MacRitchie walks.</p>

                    <p>Naya is a passionate someday-author, speaker/yeller and English nerd in general. Years ago, her mother started constantly sending her links to TED videos, and though she’ll never admit it, they got her hooked. From slam poetry to statistical analyses on the effects of global warming, she’s been held captive by too many TED talks to have passed up an opportunity to help people give their own. Being part of TEDxYouth@SAS is a wondrously surreal experience, and coaching the event’s speakers is going down on her list of favourite accomplishments. Besides getting pumped about TED and wondering who Ted is, Naya has maybe two hobbies, plus some semblance of a personality; she can usually be found working with Student Council, singing, teaching SAS’s little kids how to act, or-- surprise, surprise-- writing.</p>

                    <p>Yana, a junior, is currently entering her 11th year at SAS and is honored to have the role of curator and event host in this year’s TEDxYouth@SAS event. Her passion lies with people, ranging from learning about lives and perspectives to experiencing the world through stories. No event emphasizes and showcases the uniqueness of people better than TEDx. What she finds inspiring about it is the openness she feels when talking to her fellow executive team members and speakers. No idea or person can ever feel out of place. Outside of TEDx, Yana is involved with Peace Initiative, Varsity Basketball and out of school service at National University Hospital. She enjoys debating about politics, watching dog videos on Facebook and experiencing cultures through food, particularly sushi.</p>
